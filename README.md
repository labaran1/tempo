## How I approached the problem
<p>
First, I tried to understand the problem by writing down all the necessary requirement. I then drew a conceptual design of how  I want the UI to look and also mapping logical design onto physical platform. With knowing what to do, I labelled the tasks base on priority, tackling the most pressing task first.
